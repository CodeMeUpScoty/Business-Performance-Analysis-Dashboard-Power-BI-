# Business Performance Analysis Dashboard Power BI

Design and development of an interactive Power BI performance dashboard to monitor and evaluate organizational performance across key business metrics.

## Project Overview

This project involved the design and development of an interactive Power BI performance dashboard to monitor and evaluate organizational performance across key business metrics. 
The solution consolidates raw operational data into a single, intuitive reporting layer that enables stakeholders to track performance trends, identify risks, and support data-driven decision-making.
The primary objective was to transform static data into an executive-ready analytics product that delivers clarity, transparency, and actionable insights.
